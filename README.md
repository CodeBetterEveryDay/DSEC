# Data Science and Engineering Club

The Open Source resources in Data Engineering, Machine Learning, Data Science topics, inspired by [Data Science Masters](http://datasciencemasters.org/).


## Toolset

* [Installation](installation.txt)

* [Introduction to Git and GitHub](github)

* [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)

* [Link to the Jupyter Notebook features](http://arogozhnikov.github.io/2016/09/10/jupyter-features.html)

**The Jupyter notebook is a part of Anaconda Distribution**

The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning and much more.

## Data Acquisition and Storage

* [Introduction to Hadoop](hadoop)

## Introduction to Python (Pandas library)


* [Python is powerful... and fast; plays well with others; runs everywhere; is friendly & easy to learn; is Open.](https://www.python.org/about/)

**Pandas package is a part of Anaconda Distribution**

Pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.

* [Introduction to Panda](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html)

* [Intro to pandas data structures by Greg Reda](http://www.gregreda.com/2013/10/26/intro-to-pandas-data-structures/)

* **Python for Data Analysis** is a good book to start, written by Wes McKinney the main author of Pandas package. The second book is planning to release in August 2017.

## Introduction to Python (Numpy library)

* NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. http://www.numpy.org/

* Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. http://matplotlib.org/

* Seaborn is a Python visualization library based on matplotlib. https://seaborn.pydata.org/

## Data Wrangling with Python

Data wrangling is about taking a messy or unrefined source of data and turning it into something useful.
